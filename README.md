Introduction
The project titled "Cheers to Classification: Analyzing Wine Varieties with Naive Bayes" aims to classify different wine varieties using the Naive Bayes algorithm. The wine dataset from sklearn is used, which contains various chemical properties of wines and their corresponding labels.

Installation
To run the project, you need to install the following libraries:

numpy
pandas
scikit-learn
You can install these libraries using pip:

bash
Copy code
pip install numpy pandas scikit-learn
Usage
Import Necessary Libraries: Import the required libraries for data manipulation, model building, and evaluation.

Load the Wine Dataset: Load the wine dataset from sklearn.

Identify Features and Labels: Extract features and labels from the dataset.

Split Data: Split the dataset into training and testing sets.

Initialize and Train Naive Bayes Classifier: Initialize the Gaussian Naive Bayes classifier and train it on the training data.

Make Predictions: Use the trained model to make predictions on the testing set.

Evaluate the Classifier: Evaluate the performance of the classifier using accuracy and confusion matrix.

Features
Load and explore the wine dataset.
Split the dataset into training and testing sets.
Train a Gaussian Naive Bayes classifier.
Make predictions and evaluate the model using accuracy score and confusion matrix.
